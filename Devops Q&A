Q1. : As a devops engineer if I am doing AWS
      setup for the first time which one should  
      i need to create either Iam or VPC

Ans : 1. IAM (Identity and Access Management)

      First thing you should do after creating  
      your AWS account is secure it.

      Why? Because by default, you only have the  
      root user (full access, very risky).

      Steps:

      1. Create an Admin IAM user (instead of 
         using root).
      2. Enable MFA (Multi-Factor    
         Authentication) for the root account.
      3. Create IAM groups & policies for 
         developers/DevOps.
      4. Generate access keys (to use with CLI/
         Terraform).

ðŸ‘‰ IAM comes first because it controls who can access AWS and what they can do. Without it, everything else is insecure.

      2. VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)

         Once IAM is set up and secure, next 
         step is network setup.

         VPC defines your cloud network (like 
         your private data center inside AWS).

     Steps:

          1. Create a custom VPC (donâ€™t rely  
             only on the default one).
          2. Add subnets (public/private).
          3. Add Internet Gateway (IGW) for 
             internet access.
          4. Configure route tables.
          5. Set up security groups & NACLs.


ðŸ‘‰ VPC comes second because you need a network in place before launching EC2, RDS, or other services.

ðŸ”¹ Rule of Thumb for DevOps AWS Setup

1. Secure first â†’ IAM
2. Build network â†’ VPC
3. Then deploy resources â†’ EC2, S3, RDS, etc.

âœ… So the answer:
Create IAM first â†’ then VPC.

Q2  : concepts â€“ IPs, DNS, ports, firewalls.

Ans : 1. IP (Internet Protocol Address)

Ex  : Think of an IP as the address of a house, 
      but for a computer on a network.

    IPv4 â†’ 32-bit, e.g., 192.168.1.10
    IPv6 â†’ 128-bit, e.g., 2001:db8::1 (used  
    because IPv4 addresses are limited)


ðŸ‘‰ Two types of IPs:

Private IP (used inside local networks, e.g., 192.168.x.x, 10.x.x.x)

Public IP (unique on the internet, e.g., your WiFi/routerâ€™s IP)


ðŸ“Œ Example:
If your laptop IP is 192.168.1.5 and server IP is 192.168.1.100, they can talk directly inside the same network.

Command to check your IP:

ifconfig   # Linux/macOS
ip addr    # Linux (modern)
ipconfig   # Windows


2. DNS (Domain Name System)

DNS is like a phonebook of the internet. It converts human-readable names â†’ IP addresses.

When you type www.google.com, DNS resolves it to something like 142.250.190.14.

Without DNS, weâ€™d have to remember IPs, which is impossible at scale.


ðŸ“Œ Example:

nslookup google.com This will show the IP address of Googleâ€™s servers.

3. Ports

Ports are like doors in a house â€” they let specific types of traffic in/out.

A server has 65,535 ports.

Common ports:

22 â†’ SSH (remote login)

80 â†’ HTTP (websites)

443 â†’ HTTPS (secure websites)

3306 â†’ MySQL database

8080 â†’ Alternative HTTP for apps



ðŸ“Œ Example:
If you run a web app on your server, it may run on http://server-ip:8080.

Check open ports on Linux:

netstat -tuln
ss -tuln


4. Firewalls

A firewall is like a security guard â€” it controls what traffic can enter or leave a system.

It allows/blocks traffic based on IP + Port + Protocol.

Example:

Allow SSH (port 22) from your office IP.

Block all other traffic from unknown IPs.



On Linux (UFW firewall):

# Allow SSH
sudo ufw allow 22  

# Allow HTTP
sudo ufw allow 80  

# Deny everything else
sudo ufw default deny incoming  

# Enable firewall
sudo ufw enable


âœ… Why this matters in DevOps:

Youâ€™ll deploy apps on servers. Understanding IPs, DNS, ports, and firewalls helps you:

Configure servers

Debug connection issues

Secure your infrastructure
