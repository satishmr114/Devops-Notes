Q1. : As a devops engineer if I am doing AWS
      setup for the first time which one should  
      i need to create either Iam or VPC

Ans : 1. IAM (Identity and Access Management)

      First thing you should do after creating  
      your AWS account is secure it.

      Why? Because by default, you only have the  
      root user (full access, very risky).

      Steps:

      1. Create an Admin IAM user (instead of 
         using root).
      2. Enable MFA (Multi-Factor    
         Authentication) for the root account.
      3. Create IAM groups & policies for 
         developers/DevOps.
      4. Generate access keys (to use with CLI/
         Terraform).


ðŸ‘‰ IAM comes first because it controls who can access AWS and what they can do. Without it, everything else is insecure.

      2. VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)

         Once IAM is set up and secure, next 
         step is network setup.

         VPC defines your cloud network (like 
         your private data center inside AWS).

     Steps:

          1. Create a custom VPC (donâ€™t rely  
             only on the default one).
          2. Add subnets (public/private).
          3. Add Internet Gateway (IGW) for 
             internet access.
          4. Configure route tables.
          5. Set up security groups & NACLs.


ðŸ‘‰ VPC comes second because you need a network in place before launching EC2, RDS, or other services.

ðŸ”¹ Rule of Thumb for DevOps AWS Setup

1. Secure first â†’ IAM
2. Build network â†’ VPC
3. Then deploy resources â†’ EC2, S3, RDS, etc.

âœ… So the answer:
Create IAM first â†’ then VPC.
